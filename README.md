## Minecraft Feature World Generation

WIP Feature World Gen for Minecraft - Bedrock Edition<br />
It is defintely not done, but has some rough concepts you could use

### What does it actually do?

1. Voids world
2. Selects "biomes" based on 2 noises with several octaves each
3. Blends biome heights and 3d amount
4. Places base blocks using 3d noise

### Includes: 
  - water at y=50
  - grass surface
  - dirt (2 deep)

The Image below displays how biomes are chosen
